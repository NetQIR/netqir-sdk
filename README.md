# PyNetQIR

PyNetQIR is an SDK in Python designed to facilitate the writing of NetQIR codes. It is based on the NetQIR specification, which is an intermediate representation for distributed quantum systems. The NetQIR specification is defined in the [NetQIR specification repository](https://netqir.github.io/netqir-spec)

## TO-DO list
- [ ] %r0 to ptr in the `netqir__comm__rank()` function
- [ ] %size_world previously allocated and passed as argument in the `netqir__comm__size()` function (as ptr)
- [ ] Final declaration of functions in the resulting NetQIR code.
